# Project Title


Stocks and Crypto Research Analysis.




## GOAL
The goal of this project is to make a prediction model which will predict the future stock price based on the given dataset.

  
## What have I done?

1.Importing all the required libraries.

2.Upload the dataset and the Jupyter Notebook file.

  
## Model  Used
Long short-term memory (LSTM) 



Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture used in the field of deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. It can not only process single data points (e.g. images), but also entire sequences of data (such as speech or video inputs).
LSTM models are able to store information over a period of time.

## LIBRARIES NEEDED

* numpy

* pandas
