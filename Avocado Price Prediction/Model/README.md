# Avocado Price Prediction

In this project we will be working with an avocado sales dataset, indicating and predciting on how does Avocado sales will take place and doing the visualization of the dataset to understand the sales of avocado.

**GOAL**

The goal is to predict Avocado Prices.

Dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices)

**WHAT I HAD DONE**
- Discussed some major columns on which Avocado Prices maybe dependent
- Then I used different regression models present in sklearn to train the model.
- Used data visualization methods to understand the past sales

**MODELS USED**
-  Linear Regression
-  Ridge Regression
-  Random Forest Regressor

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

**CONCLUSION**
By using Linear Regression I got 
 ```
      Accuracy of testing data: 85.05
 ``` 

 
  By using Ridge Regression I got 
 ```
    Accuracy of testing data: 85.07
 ``` 
 
 By using Random Forest I got 
 ```
    Accuracy of testing data: 93.46
 ```
