# Body Parts Recognition Model

# GOAL 
The main goal of the project is to analyze the parts of the body and recognize them. On the basis of it, model is trained, to predict the body parts by input the pictures.

# DATASET 
* (Dataset Link)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/linkanjarad/body-parts-dataset]

# WHAT I HAD DONE 
* Data Exploration done with the help of EDA, to better understand the Body parts dataset and get useful insights.
* I prepare dataset for model training and model testing purpose.
* Then, normalizing the images dataset for 255 pixels color ration.
* Now, build a neural network to learn from the prepared dataset.
* At the end, adding a fully connected layers which do last step processing and recognizes the images.
* Hence, did the Model Creation.

# MODELS USED 
* Sequential
* Dense layers
* Fully connected layers

# LIBRARIES NEEDED 
* cv2
* tensorflow
* keras

# CONCLUSION 
From the models used, Accuracy achieved around 99.64%

### Loss:- 1.37%

## Accuracy:- 99.64 %
