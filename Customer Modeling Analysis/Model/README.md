PROJECT TITLE : Customer Modeling Analysis

GOAL : To predict about the customers modeling using ANN .

WHAT I HAD DONE : In this project first I performed a exploratory data analysis on the Customer Modeling dataset which includes of data cleaning , data manipulation, data preprocessing , data visualization and after that I did training and testing , then I did the feature scaling and used ANN for the prediction. While in the EDA part I have included different plots for the different visualizations of our dataset .
During the prediction I kept the epochs as 200 and batch size as 256 using different activation function and the optimizers and got a accuracy score of 68 % which can be further increase by Hyper parameter Tuning.
Some plots which we used for visualizing the dataset are Histogram , Barplot , Boxplot, Heatmap , Scatter plot , Pairplot , Jointplot etc.



LIBRARIES:

PANDAS

MATPLOTLIB

SEABORN

Conclusion : We get to know why customers are withdrawing their account from bank.
The accuracy we got using ANN in 200 epochs is 68 % and the loss is 0.002 which can be further reduced durinh hyperparameter tuning .
